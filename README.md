PROJECT NAME: Pollen - A Honeycomb for Sustainable Practices

Target AUDIENCE:
- Consumers seeking sustainable products and services
- Businesses committed to sustainability practices

Functionalities:
- The user will be able to create an account on the platform, and post their sustainable actions on the platform in the form of a blog.
